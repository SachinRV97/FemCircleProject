# FemCircle – Women-Only E-Commerce Platform

## 1. Introduction

FemCircle is a secure and exclusive women-only e-commerce web application developed using ASP.NET Core MVC and Microsoft SQL Server. The platform is designed to provide a safe, trusted, and community-driven digital marketplace exclusively for women.

In the current digital era, most e-commerce platforms are open to all users and often lack safety mechanisms specifically designed for women. This can lead to privacy concerns, fraudulent activities, and unsafe interactions. FemCircle addresses this gap by creating a verified women-only marketplace where users can buy, sell, donate, and exchange products in a secure environment.

The system promotes women empowerment, sustainability through reuse of products, and safe digital interaction.

## 2. Problem Statement

Most existing online marketplaces do not focus specifically on women’s safety and privacy. Women may face:

- Fake profiles and fraudulent users
- Harassment or misuse of personal information
- Lack of secure identity verification
- No dedicated women-exclusive marketplace

There is a need for a secure, women-only e-commerce platform that ensures safe transactions, verified users, and a supportive digital community.

## 3. Objectives

The main objectives of the FemCircle project are:

- To develop a women-only secure online marketplace.
- To enable users to buy, sell, donate, and exchange products.
- To implement secure user registration and login functionality.
- To provide role-based access (User and Admin).
- To allow admin monitoring and control of the platform.
- To promote sustainability by encouraging reuse of products.
- To ensure secure storage and management of user and product data.

## 4. Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based application built using ASP.NET Core MVC architecture with Microsoft SQL Server as the database.

Key features include:

- User registration and login (Username & Password)
- Role-based access (User / Admin)
- Product listing and management
- Buy, sell, donate, and exchange options
- Order placement and management
- Admin dashboard for monitoring users and products
- Secure database management using Entity Framework Core

The system ensures that only registered women users can access and use the platform.

## 5. System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Presentation Layer** – Razor Views (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript)
- **Business Logic Layer** – Controllers in ASP.NET Core MVC
- **Data Access Layer** – Entity Framework Core with MSSQL

This structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.
